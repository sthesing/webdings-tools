I wrote the Webdings Tools package back in 2005 while doing a research project for my Diploma thesis in the field of special needs education.  
This was before Sun open-sourced their JDK and quite a lot of half-finished FLOSS implementations of Java were out and about. Lots of the Java classpath was not implemented, yet and even more documentation was missing.

I wrote quite a lot of wrappers and little helpers, most of which are obsolete now and probably were obsolete, back then. But I wrote them, and I used them and now I put them here. Maybe they are of some use to someone, if only as an example on how not to structure your code ;-)  
Maybe the [`MailtoLinkEncoder`](src/de/webdings/tools/MailtoLinkEncoder.java) and the [`CL`](src/de/webdings/tools/CL.java) (a simple wrapper handling command line input) are still useful.

Back in 2005, I released this under GPL2 on [Savannah](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/jannis/), now I release this under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/).
